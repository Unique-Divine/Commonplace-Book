### Design Patterns

Why use "design patterns"?

* Design patterns let your write better code more quickly by providing a clearer picture of how to implement the design
* Design patterns encourage code reuse and accomodate change by supplying well-tested mechanisms for delegation, composition, and other non-inheritance based reuse techniques
* Design patterns encourage more legible and maintainable code

Delegation? Composition?

* delegation: a pattern where a given object provides an interface to a set of operations. However, the actual work for those operations is performed by one or more other objects.
* composition: Creating objects with other objects as members. Should be used when a "has-a" relationship appears.

What are design patterns?

Which resources will you use to start learning about design patterns?

GOF patterns (C++). Then, potentially Head First Design Patterns (Java)/
