# 1. Introduction
                        
## 1.1. What is a Commonplace (Book)? 

A commonplace book is a system for writing down and sorting all manner
of tidbits: quotes, anecdotes, observations, and information gleaned
from books, conversations, movies, song lyrics, social posts, podcasts,
life experiences, or anything else that you might want to return to
later.

It's called a commonplace it's an aggregate, an all-encompassing system
for storing all of the the most important points you learn in one common
place---a central resource that makes it easy to find, re-read, and
utilize each piece of wisdom you have obtained.

## 1.2. Why? | The Purpose of this Commonplace Book 

**Save Hours on Research**: Beginners and intermediate learners often marvel at the way masters of subjects like mathematics and computer programming seem to effortlessly call upon related knowledge during presentations, lectures, and tutorials. Eventually, it starts to seem as though there's an insurmountably vast space of knowledge that these masters have already acquired and memorized, and in order for someone to reach a similar level of abilty,  he or she'd have to retain the majority of this vast space too. I've found that this is often not the case. 

**Find Unexpected Connections**

**Focus future Learning**

<!-- 
**We are at war**

Constantly seeking out new experiences and opportunities to grow. We
employ active recall methods, watch videos, lectures, and seminars. We
listen to mentors and podcasts, captivated by the new insights and
perspectives that enter our psychology.

As voracious learners, we are in a forever war

# 2. Metalearning & Doing

<!-- TODO Add chapter description. -->

## 2.1. Project-based Learning

### 2.1.1. Ultralearning

**Ultralearning** is a strategy for learning quickly and effectively. It's self-directed, intense, and ruthlessly efficient.

> "Despite their idiosyncrasies, the ultralearners had a lot of shared traits. They usually worked alone, often toiling for months and years without much more than a blog entry to announce their efforts. Their interests tended toward obsession. They were aggressive about optimizing their strategies, fiercely debating the merits of esoteric concepts such as interleaving practice, leech thresholds, or keyword mnemonics. Above all, they cared about learning. Their motivation to learn pushed them to tackle intense projects, even if it often came at the sacrifice of credentials or conformity."

##### 2.1.1.0.1. How to become an ultralearner 

1. **Metalearning**: First Draw a Map
2. **Focus**: Sharpen Your Knife
3. **Directness**: Go Straight Ahead
4. **Drill**
5. **Retrieval**: Test to Learn
6. **Feedback**: Don't Dodge the Punches
7. **Retention**: Don't Fill a Leaky Bucket
8. **Intuition: Dig Deep Before Building Up** Develop your intuition
    through play and exploration of concepts and skills.
9. **Experimentation**

#### 2.1.1.1. Ultralearning [Core Message (YouTube)](https://youtu.be/4xCiHppPfEs)

- A lot of what's taught in school is theory that's only useful for PhD students.
- An ultralearning project is about building skills, not just building knowledge.

#### 2.1.1.2. To Start Any Ultralearning Project 

1.  Make and **follow a Metalearning map**. Think hard about what you want to be able to do by the end of your ultralearning project. Then identify what skills will be critical to your success.
    - What concepts do I need to understand?
    - What facts do I need to memorize?
    - What procedures do I need to practice?  

2.  **Design and use practice drills**
    -   Based on the info from metalearning, design drills.
    -   Practice drills should have quick feedback loops that target key
        areas, just like a bodybuilder would use dips to target the
        triceps.

3.  **Overlearn**. Go beyond the requirements of what is necessry to learn to further
    reinforce what IS necessary.

    To embrace overlearning, ask:

    -   what's my target performance, and
    -   what's the next level?

    Commit to an even harder performance than the one you're training for.

To recap: 1. Metalearn 2. Drill 3. Overlearn

#### 2.1.1.3. How to Start Your Own Ultralearning Project (Part One) [[blog]](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2016/07/28/ultralearn-diy-1/)

Designing your own ultralearning project has three parts:

1.  Figuring out what you want to learn deeply, intensely and quickly.

2.  Choosing which format you want for your project.

3.  Preparing to start learning.

### 2.1.2. Getting Things Done (GTD)

> "If your mind is empty, it is always ready for anything; it is open to everything"- Shunryu Suzuki

##### 2.1.2.0.1. Basic workflow 

|            |            |             |
| ---------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| 1. Capture | 2. Clarify | 3. Organize |
| 4. Reflect | 5. Engage  |             |
|            |            |             |

#### 2.1.2.1. GTD | Overview

**Projects**: A project is any outcome for which you need more than one action step to achieve it. You often do not *do* projects, you do actions which may be related to the completion of a project.

**Natural Planning of Projects**: This is a way to think of projects to create maximum value with minimal effort and time expenditure.

1.  Why | Define the purpose, principles, and values of the project
2.  What | Visualize the desired outcome
3.  How | Brainstorm and organize ideas on how to accomplish your goal(s)
4.  When / What now? | Identify your next immediate actions.

**Capture**: You must capture all the things you consider incomplete in your
universe; personal or professional, big or small, urgent or not.

**Clarify**: Clarifying is the act of defining and clarifying, one by one, all the
stuff in your inbox, until it is empty.

- (1) Discard a task if it is worthless, (2) incubate it in the Someday/Maybe list, or (3) keep it as Reference Material, if it is potentially useful information.
- If an action takes less than two minutes, do it. If now is not the right time (be careful not to procrastinate), defer it to a specific time in the future.

**Organize**: To organize things that are actionable, you need a Projects list.
- The calendar is sacred territory. If you put something there, it is because it has to be done on the date indicated.

**Reflect**: The system cannot be static. If you want to be able to correctly choose your actions, you have to keep the system current. You need to review the whole picture of your life and your work at regular intervals and at the appropriate levels.

-   Every day, you will need to review your Calendar and Next Actions list organized by contexts.
-   Every week, you must review the remaining lists to keep your system clean, clear, complete and updated. The purpose of the Weekly Review is that your mind gets empty again.
-   Every so often you should review the big picture; clarifying your long-term goals and visions and principles that ultimately determine how you make your decisions.

**Engage**: The purpose of all this management and workflow is to facilitate the decision of what you should be doing at any time.

Your priorities are set by a hierarchy of levels or perspective. From top down, this is your:
1. Life purpose,
2. Vision of yourself in the future
3. Medium-term goals 
4. Areas of responsibility
5. Current projects and everyday actions

#### 2.1.2.3. Review, in detail

Review is a key component of GTD, to the point that **if you do not do it effectively, you are probably not following the methodology the right way**. It is a time we spend to ensure that we are always working on what is actually important, a way to be proactive and take control.

**Get clear**: The first phase of review is to do clean-up, collecting everything and
processing it. The result should be that everything is in the GTD system
and the Inbox is empty. Clarify and assign dates to tasks.

**Get current**: The second stage is to keep your system up to date. This is **absolutely
necessary for you to fully trust your system**. Review the:
-   **Inbox, past, and upcoming events** | Is there aything pending? Confirm that everything is done or update deadlines if necessary.
-   **Projects** \| Evaluate the status of each project. Review the support material and add new actions if necessary. Make sure there is a next action for each active project.

**Get creative**: You have everything under control. Now it is time to dig up old
longings, to imagine, to dream, and to invent.

- **Someday/Maybe list** \| Is it time to activate a project that was put off or abandoned? Are there things that no longer make sense?
- **Imagine** \| What are your big picture ambitions? How can you improve? What new ideas should you add to the system?

###  2.2.2. How to Take Effective Notes When Reading 

Aun Abdi has been reading a book and a half per week for the past two years.
He describes his process for getting the most out of what he reads in
this video.

1.  **Preparation**: Have your reading accessories ready. Make sure that you are ready for reading. Aun uses two pens and a highlighter to jot down notes both in the book and in a notebook on the side.
2.  **Question everything**: Have a question in mind before you start. In general, ask lots of questions and look into them.
3.  **Resonance**: Whilst you read, highlight and write down any ideas that resonate with you. Anything that keeps you engaged and active in the reading process is a plus. 
    - Pro tip: Make sure to read the full page/section before you highlight or take any notes. This helps prevent you from highlighting everything instead of prioritizing the important bits.
    - Some people don't like that notetaking breaks their flow. If you find this happening, take notes after full chapters. You might find that this helps with retention because it requires extra efforts for active recall. Try writing a summary at the close of a chapter.
4.  **Action items**: Write down some principles you want to put into action after reading every book, especially if it's a productivity book or a book about a specific skill. Aun recommends drafting 5-10 principles up with each book that fits this description.
6.  **Review**: Review sessions. Derived from *The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People*: Sharpening the saw. Review your notes rigorously. Aun does this every single week and schedules in time to do so. This can be as simple as transferring notes from a notebook to the computer. Schedule at least an hour every single week to review your notes.

Having a structured reading routine and structured notetaking strategy is of paramount importance for effective learning. This is key to getting the most out of what you read.

How many times have you read something, got to the end of the page, and forgot what you just read? And you go back and you reread it, and you still don't know what you read? That's a big problem because you're wasting your most valuable asset: your time. 

> "The key to reading comprehension is asking more questions... Questions are the answer." 

Never just pick up a book and read it. Never just listen to a podcast. You must go into a state where you're going to be more receptive. 

A simple notetaking method for maximizing retention and expansion of knowledge:
1. **Capture and create**: Split a page in half. On one side, take notes and on the other make notes. One side for capturing and one side for creating. 
2. What are you creating? What goes on this side? Write down your impressions about what you're capturing. If you get distracted, it's better that you get distracted using your imagination on the "create" side of the page because this will both speed up your learning process and make things stick. 
3. And what are the main questions you should try to answer in the create section?
   1. **How** → How can I use this? Make the things that are going to yield the highest return as simple and easy to understand as you can. 
   2. **Why** → Why must I use this? Who's counting on you to win today? Some people are willing to do much more for other people than they'll do for themselves. Who's counting on you to be at your best? You need to find your motivation in your reading so that you can complete the task and remember key information. 
   > "If it's not a must, you're not going to do it because you have plenty other things to do." - Jim Kwik. 
   > "Reasons reap results."- Jim Kwik. 
   3. **When** → When will I use this? The calendar is one of the strongest productivity tools you have. Many say they want to work out or worry about self care and self love. You may know lots of actionable information, but how does your calendar reflect that? 

> "If you're not going to use what you're learning [from reading], you're no better off than someone who can't read at all." - Jim Kwik. 


Information, Inspiration, Implementation -> Integration

When you learn something, it becomes a part of who you are; it becomes integrated. Integration connects the head, heart, and hands.

#### 2.2.2.1. Maximizing Your Understanding of Books.  

- Bill Gates takes notes in the margins of books.
- Maintenance rehearsal versus elaborative rehearsal $\to$ You want elaborative rehearsal with your reading, new pieces of information hooking into old memories. Taking notes in the margin will help you do this.

####  2.2.2.2. Get the Most Out of Your Books - Be an Active Reader. 

Active listening: Requires understanding, full concentration, recollection of the conversation, and minimizes confusion.

By engaging with a book, arguing with the text, asking questions, and writing a lot while reading, we can perform active reading too.

-   Helps with retention
-   Makes transfer from book to real life more likely

Don't become a collector. Are you more concerned with the content of the book or its appearance. Remember the reason you opened a book.

### 2.2.3. How to read scientific papers

2017 scientific paper by Hubbard and Dunbar, about reading scientific
papers.

Hubbard, K. E., & Dunbar, S. D. (2017). Perceptions of scientific
research literature and strategies for reading papers depend on academic
career stage. PloS one, 12(12), e0189753.

image

1. Read the intro and background first, then the abstract (fast pass).
2. Read discussion (fast pass)
3. Attempt to interpret figures and define variables (highlight)
4. Re-read the other sections(highlight, slow pass)
5. Summarize the intro and background
6. Synthesize notes and ask questions. Record this somewhere (like a commonplace book)
7. Read methods, experiments, results, conclusion (fast pass). If necessary, go through a slow pass, highlighting and archiving the most salient points
8.  **Don't forget** to take note of key references.
9.  Attempt to solve all of your mysteries.

#### 2.2.3.1. Three-Pass Approach - Scientific paper reading

A simple "three-pass" approach to prevent drowning in the details before getting into the valuable bits. You'll be able to adjust the depth of paper evaluation depending on your needs and available time.

The first pass gives you a general idea about the paper. The second pass
lets you grasp the paper's content, but not its details. The third pass
helps you understand the paper in depth.

##### 2.2.3.1.1. First pass: Quick pass

This pass is a quick scan to get a view from 10,000 feet and decide whether to do any more passes. It should take $\approx 5$ to $10$ minutes. Steps:

1. Carefully read the title, abstract, and introduction.
2. Read the section and sub-section headings, but ignore everything else.
3. Glance at the mathematical content (if any) to determine the underlying theoretical foundations
4. Read the conclusions
5. Glance over the references, taking notice of which ones you've already read.

##### 2.2.3.1.2. Second pass: Close reading

Should take up to an hour. Read the paper with greater care, ignoring
graphs and minute details. Note any terms you didn't understand, or
questions you want to ask.

1.  Understand the figures, diagrams, and other illustrations.
2.  Read in full, but skip proofs and overcomplicated equations.
3.  Mark relevant unread references for future reading and to learn more
    about the background of the paper.

You may still not understand the paper after the second pass because the
subject matter is too unfamiliar. You can either (a) postpone reading
the paper further until further notice, (b) return to the paper after
researching the unknown terminology and questions raised, or (c) move on
to the third pass.

##### 2.2.3.1.3. Third pass: Implement and extend.

Virtually re-implement the paper. Identify and challenge every assumption in every statement. I called this "solving all the mysteries" in the previous section. Jot down ideas for future work and be able to explain in clear terms the entire paper from memory.

## 2.3. Software Projects

#### 2.3.0.1. Software Portfolio Overview

##### 2.3.0.1.1. Key factors of Good Software Portfolio 

- Completeness
- Functionality
- Readability
- Documentation/information

#### 2.3.0.2. Solve all of your mysteries

The time it takes programmers to finish projects varies wildly. This
section will go over why some people are spending 50+ hours on projects
that should be done in 5.

-   Faster programmers can explain their code and strategy even if it doesn't work.
-   Faster programmers dig deep and really try to understand the functions, the classes, the API's that are at their disposal so that they can apply them to solve problems.
-   Slower programmers are trying to look for a shortcut. They want to use stack overflow or some other site. This difference may not be noticeable on smaller beginner projects, but over time this difference becomes huge and will ultimately be crucial to one's long-term growth and flexibility.
-   Never take code on faith
    -   If code is in your program, you should take time to learn about what it does
    -   Find some documentation. Read about the functions and classes used and DO NOT move forward until you understand each piece of code.
-   Read documentation
-   Solve ALL of your mysteries
    -   You wrote a bunch of code, thought you knew what it did, and it's behaving mysteriously. A lot of times, people will try a couple of thing. They'll sort of randomly try stuff and even if the problem goes away and they don't really know why, they just move on. This is a bad idea.
    -   When you don't understand a bug, you are destined to repeat it. You need to understand why that bug occurred. Get out the documentation. Get a second pair of eyes, whatever you need to do. But, understand why this behavior is occurring.

### 2.4.1. Studying 80+ hours a week

[Zach Highley | Anking](https://youtu.be/FARXrLsBNJY)

Doing intellectual work efficiently is tough. It takes a lot of dedication and willpower, and yet, people aren't often strategic in their approach to being efficient. To maintain focus and efficiency with studying, work, etc., you need to think about your life as if you're a bodybuilder or Olympic athlete.

#### 2.4.1.1. Sleep

- Brain gene expression during REM sleep depends on prior waking experience. Riheiro et al. 1999. (paper): Subjects played a tower of honoi game during a study and were retested on the task a week later. A large improvement in the task was noted on average. However, when experimenters tampered with the REM cycle of subjects, performance saw no such improvement, even if the retest occurred just a day after the original.
- Sleep Inspires Insight. Wanger et al. 2004. (paper): This paper displays more evidence to suggest that a night's sleep can have magical properties. A cognitive test that demanded some mathematical creativity was given to people twice with a 12 hour interval between tests. When the test subjects had a full night's rest in between tests rather than two daytime tests, the normal correct response rate more than doubled.

What can we learn from studies like this?

Not only is the brain locking in knowledge for long-term storage when we
sleep, it is also trying to solve problems, explore, and find ways to
connect pieces of information inside our head.

There's a book called "Why We Sleep" by Matthew Walker that has a lot of
helpful information on this topic. I this book, he says that once you
start to drop below 7 hours of sleep, you'll start to see detriments in
health and performance.

The quality of sleep is also important. Some things you can do to
increase sleep quality are:
- Intensely exercise
- Increase light exposure during the day
- Reduce (blue) light exposure at night. Keep your bedroom as dark as you can and on the colder side.
- Don't consume caffeine within 6 hours of bedtime. Why? Caffeine has a fairly long half-life, which means that even after you don't feel it working, it's going to stick around in your system. The mean half-life of caffeine in the plasma of healthy individuals is about 5 hours. However, caffeine's elimination half-life may range between 2 and 10 hours.
- Avoid drugs and alcohol.

#### 2.4.1.2. Exercise

-   Roig et al. The effects of cardiovascular exercise on human memory. 2013. (paper): Cardiovascular exercise performed in close temporal proximity to a session of skill practice has shown to facilitate motor memory consolidation. 2 bouts of intense treadmill running ($\approx 3$ min) before doing vocabulary tasks increase peripheral concentrations of catecholamines (chemical signal related to certain stresses) such as dopamine and epinephrine and accelerated the rate of learning by 20%.

-   One meta-analysis (combined results of multiple scientific studies) looked at 21 studies and the effect of acute and long-term cardiovascular exercise on human memory. "Acute exercise improves memory in a time-dependent fashion by priming the molecular process involved in the encoding and consolidation of newly acquired information."

#### 2.4.1.3. Environment

Where are you studying? Set a consistent place for your studying that is
clean, distraction-free, and yours.

1.  Take advantage of classical conditioning here. You can even just
    change seats when you're in work vs. play mode.

2.  Clean your workspace.

3.  The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up by Marie Kondo (book): "It
    is not our memories but the person we have become because of those
    past experiences that we should treasure. This is the lesson these
    keepsakes teach us when we sort them. The space in which we live
    should be for the person we are becoming now, not for the person we
    were in the past."

#### 2.4.1.4. Mindset

-   Don't frame things as "I have to" but rather as "I get to". I get to
    learn. I get to work with these people.

-   Silence the noise. Only focus on the task at hand, what you have to
    do right now.

-   How to Stop Worrying and Start Living by Dale Carnegie (book):
    "Live in day-tight compartments." Only focus on the thing you're
    going to complete today. Don't worry about what you have to do
    later. Remember, don't count the costs.

-   Formulate a specific study plan for the day that is specific.

#### 2.4.1.5. Increasing developer productivity 

1.  Be less random. Try to add structure to your day.

2.  Stop wasting time: Cut down use of social media, analytics, etc.
    Turn off notifications for things.

3.  Have well-planned project structure: Create a template/framework for
    your projects and chunk work into small tasks.

4.  Use project management tools rather than email. Use your external
    brain rather than keeping stuff in your head.
5.  Code faster by doing the following:
    -  Use snippets, keyboard shortcuts, vim, etc.
    -  Find tools that speed up tasks.
    -  Practice typing faster.
    -  Learn bug trackers, testing frameworks, and other time-efficient extensions.

> "We should hunt out the helpful pieces of teaching and the spirited and noble-minded sayings which are capable of immediate practical application--not far far-fetched or archaic expressions or extravagant metaphors and figures of speech--and learn them so well that words become works." - Seneca

> "I have a friend who's an artist and has sometimes taken a view which I don't agree with very well. He'll hold up a flower and say "look how beautiful it is," and I'll agree. Then he says "I as an artist can see how beautiful this is but you as a scientist take this all apart and it becomes a dull thing," and I think that he's kind of nutty.

I can appreciate the beauty of a flower. At the same time, I see much more about the flower than he sees. I could imagine the cells in there, the complicated actions inside, which also have a beauty.

The fact that the colors in the flower evolved in order to attract insects to pollinate it is interesting; it means that insects can see the color. It adds a question: does this aesthetic sense also exist in the lower forms? Why is it aesthetic? All kinds of interesting questions which the science knowledge only adds to the excitement, the mystery and the awe of a flower. It only adds. I don't understand how it subtracts." - Richard Feynman on the beauty of a flower
