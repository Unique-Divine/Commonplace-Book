	abstract={The leading treads towards social networking services had drawn massive
	public attention from last one and half decade. The amount of data that is
	uploaded to these social networking services is increasing day by day. So,
	there is massive requirement to study the highly dynamic behavior of users
	towards these services. This is a preliminary work to model the user
	patterns and to study the effectiveness of machine learning predictive
	modeling approaches on leading social networking service Facebook. We
	modeled the user comment patters, over the posts on Facebook Pages and
	predicted that how many comments a post is expected to receive in next H
	hrs. In order to automate the process, we developed a software prototype
	consisting of the crawler, Information extractor, information processor and
	knowledge discovery module. We used Neural Networks and Decision Trees,
	predictive modeling techniques on different dataset variants and evaluated
	them under Hits(at)10 (custom measure), Area Under Curve, Evaluation Time
	and Mean Absolute error evaluation metrics. We concluded that the Decision
	trees performed better than the Neural Networks under light of all
	evaluation metrics.}
