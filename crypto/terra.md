Terra is a public blockchain protocol deploying a suite of algorithmic decentralized stablecoins.

- LUNA community members are called LUNAtics.
- Terra has an industry-leading decentralized stablecoin called $UST
- Terra is built on the Cosmos SDK
- Terra is built on Tendermint Consensus
- Terra is most known for its ability to host algorithmic stablecoins on its network.

#### How does Terra work?

The Terra protocol is a decentralized and open-source public blockchain protocol for algorithmic stablescoins.

**Algorithmic stablecoin**: A cryptocurrency that tracks the price of any asset, usually currency. Algorithmic stablecoins maintain their price peg through a set of rules or software instead of an underlying asset. 

The Terra protocol creates stablecoins that can track the price of fiat currencies. These stablecoins can be traded on the Terra blockchain. The Terra protcol consist

### TerraUSD (UST)

TerraUSD (UST) is a decentralized stablecoin running on Ethereum that attempts to maintain a value of $1.00. 

Q: What differentitates a decentralized stablecoin from a centralized one? A centralized stablecoin usually tends to be backed by US dollars in a bank account or treasury. 

UST isn’t backed by US dollars in a bank account. How does it maintain a stable value? In order to mint 1 TerraUSD, $1.00 worth of TerraUSD’s reserve asset, LUNA, must be burned. 

### Terra Interchain

Terra is a cross-chain protocol.
