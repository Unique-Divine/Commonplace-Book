COMS 6998: Empirical Methods of Data Science 


How do you conduct sound research win data science and big data?

# Lec. 1-2

## How psychology benefits from the introduction of data science techniques

Having real time data adds more more depth and legitimacy to results than surveying after. 

Data science benefits from being rooted in the tried and true methodologies of social science research. 

Today:
- scientific method
- research approaches
- reliability nd validity
- in-class assignment 

Data science is founded in rational empiricism and the scientific method.
- empiricism: gaining knowledge from measured findings
- scientific method: 
  1. Begin with a testable hypothesis
  2. Gather evidence / collect data
  3. Revise and conduct further studies
  4. Make findings public and therefore open to scrutiny 

Never say "prove" outside of math. Studies can lend evidence that seems to suggest something, but they cannot tell us anything definitive.

Hypothesis-driven research: theory $\to$ hypothesis $\to$ research method/design $\to$ evidence $\to$ publishing

How to move from a theory to a testable hypothesis
- theory: an dea or set of ideas that describe a particular event, process, or behavior
- testable hypothesis: prediction that is formulated in such a way that observations are able to confirm or disconfirm

### Research approaches
Now, let's suppose you have a testable hypothesis. What do you do? 

Quantitative vs. mixed-method vs. qualitative: Think of it as a continuum. 

Quantitative
- numbers
- closed-ended questions and responses
- experiments

Qualitative
- words
- open-ended questions and responses
- case studies, narratives, etc. 

Mixed methods incorporate elements of both. 

### Philosphical wordlviews

Postpositivism
- Represents the traditional form of research
- Lends to quantitative research
- Challenges the traditional notion of the absolute truth of knowledge: When studying human behavior and actions, we cannot prove anything in absolute terms.
- Deterministic philosophy: Causes determine effects.
- Reductionistic: Reduces ideas into small discrete sets that are easily testable

Constructivist
- Lends itself to qualitative research: Open-ended questions
- Belief that we as humans develop subjective meanings that are key to understanding the world
- Heavy emphasis on participants' view of the question at hand, and the interaction of participants (as we are social beings and thus understanding the world must be with this lens)

Transformative
- Research needs to consider politics and political change
- Contains an "action agenda"

Pragmatic
- About what works - solutions and applications
- Uses all approaches

### Gathering Evidence

Correlations: Do changes in one variable link to changes in another one?

If two variables are correlated, what does this tell us? 3 possiblities: A causes B, B causes A, or some other factors cause both. 

Causation
- We cnnot make casual inference unless:
  - A and B occur together with regularity
  - Either A or B precedes the other in time
  - Theoretical explanation exists
  - Other explanations can be ruled out
- The ultimate goal of research is "causal"

Defining variables
- Operational definition: Define a variable in concrete terms to make sure they are reliable and valid
  - Easily measurable physical properties (e.g. distance). 
  - Not so easy to measure properties (e.g. happiness and other psychological properties)

Randomization
- Random sampling: Each member of a population has an equal chance of inclusion into a sample (unbiased sample)
- Random assignment: too experimental group vs. control group, to training set vs. validation set

Reliability
- Refers to reproducibility of data. We want to see similar findings across trials/studies, e.g. the Mozart Effect, the Rockstar Principle
- Another way to define reliability refers to absence of measurement error
  - Focus is on the way researchers measure their variables
