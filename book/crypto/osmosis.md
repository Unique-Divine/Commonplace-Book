- [x] Q: What is IBC compatibility?

IBC stands for Inter Blockchain Communication. If a Cosmos zone is IBC compatible, this means the zone can communicate with all of the other zones on the Cosmos Hub.

- [ ] Q: What is Osmosis?

Osmosis is a Cosmos automated market maker (AMM)  for interchain assets created by Osmosis Labs. Documentation can be found at https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis. 

The goal of Osmosis is to provide tools that extend the use of AMMs within the Cosmos ecosystem beyond traditional swap-type use cases. 

Osmosis is built using the Cosmos SDK.  

Osmosis is an AMM laboratory: an active testing ground where experimentation on optimizing AMMs for a wide variety of financial assets takes place.

Osmosisâ€™ parameterizable inputs enable the creation of newer DeFi asset types like options, dynamic fee markets that adapt to moments of high volatility, work to mitigate undesirable outcomes like impermanent loss for liquidity providers (LP)

Osmosis is IBC compatible (see Cosmos docs). The Osmosis zone can communicate with all other zones in the Cosmos network.

The native asset of Osmosis is OSMO, a governance token that provides its token holders capabilities to decide the strategic direction and future changes to the Osmosis protocol. 

- [x] Q: What makes an asset interchain, or cross-chain?

> "Terra-Bridge is a protocol for interchain transfers between Ethereum and Bitcoin."

Internchain aseets seem to be tokens that are connected and interact between separate blockchains. 

- [ ] Q: "Osmosis is a fair-launched, customizable automated market maker for interchain assets that allows the creation and management of non-custodial, self-balancing, interchain token index similar to one of Balancer." Tell me about [Balancer](http://balancer.finance/whitepaper) and self-balancing. 


- [ ] Cloze: Non-custodial is synonymous to decentralized. Thus, traditional financial institutions offer centralized (custodial) products. 

- [ ] Q: What does it mean for a token index to be self-balancing?

- [ ] Q: What's a non-custodial token index?

- [ ] Q: How do I identify a liqudity provider on Osmosis?

- [ ] Q: Why link [this Osmosis repo and file](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/blob/main/cmd/osmosisd/cmd/balances_from_state_export.go) specifically?

- [ ] Q: Why do I keep hearing about the Keply Wallet?
THe Keplr Wallet is essentially the Metamask of Cosmos. It has a simple user interaace, private key security, and allows you to store ATOM. 

- [ ] Q: Tell me more about the OSMO token.
