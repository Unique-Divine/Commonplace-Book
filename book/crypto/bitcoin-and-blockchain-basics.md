# bitcoin-and-blockchain-basics

Q: Distributed and decentralized are related concepts with different meanings. What's the difference?
: Although the bitcoin blockchain is decentralized, not all P2P networks are decentralized. Many systems still rely on a central authority to guide network activity.

altcoin : Alternative coin. 
: Everything that's not Bitcoin.

### Blockchain Basics

Q: Bitcoin's current headline on Google: "Bitcoin: Open source P2P money" What is P2P and how does it work?
: In computer science, a **peer-to-peer (P2P) network** consists of a group of devices that collectively store and share files. Each participant, also called a node or peer, in the network has equal power and performs the same tasks. 
: Bitcoin is considered a **peer-to-peer (P2P)** technology because it operates with no central bank or other authority; the managing of transactions and issuing of bitcoins is carried out collectively on the **blockchain**.

Bitcoin technology is open-source. Nobody owns or controls the Bitcoin blockchain.

Blockchain
: Blockchain is a system in which a record of transactions, such as those made with bitcoin or another cryptocurrency, are maintained via a peer-to-peer network.  Blockchain is a **tamper-evident** database that acts as a **distributed ledger** wherein the history of asset exchanges that take place in a network are recorded in a sequential chain of cryptographic hash-linked blocks. 

Blockchain differs from a typical database, the kind that organizes its data in tables, in that it stores  information in blocks that are chained together. **All blockchains are databases** but not all databases are blockchains. Similarly, all **blockchains are distributed ledgers** but not all distributed ledgers are blockchains. 

Q: Why is it called a blockchain?
: Blockchains store data in **blocks** that are then chained together. Blocks are simply collections of information with certain storage capacities that, when filled, are chained onto the previously filled block. 

Distributed ledger vs. Blockchain
: Blockchain and distributed ledger technology have an analogous relationship to Kleenex and facial tissues. Blockchain is a type fo distributed ledger that has become so popular that it's the first thing that comes to mind when people think of distributed ledger technology.
: A ledger is distributed if it is decentralized, i.e. has no need for an intermediary or central authority to for validation. The records on a distributed ledger are only stored when a consensus has been reached by all parties involved. These records detail transactions such as the exchange of assets or data among participants (nodes) in the network.

Q: Why is blockchain tamper-evident? What does that even mean?


Cryptography ensures tamper-proof security, authentication, and integrity of transactions.
